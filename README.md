# Synchrotron_Pulse
## Introduction
This [**Jupyter notebook**](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) demonstrates the detailed time structure of a [**synchrotron pulse**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrotron_radiation). It specificly shows the change of electric field with time.
In order to show the detald of this case, I created two files. The first one synchrotron pulse.ipynb demonstrate the retarded electric fild with different beta value, while the detailed time structure.ipynb indicates the moving charge's radiation with different direction of it's velocity.

## Dependencies
The notebook requires the following python modules:

> - [matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)

> - [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)

> - [ipython](https://pypi.org/project/ipython/)

> - [scipy](https://pypi.org/project/scipy/)

## Usage
Clone the repository by typing 

> **git clone** http://github.com/mengkel/Synchrotron_Pulse.git 

>Then open the notebook. For example, on a linux type system, type 

>**cd Synchrotron_Pulse**  
>**jupyter notebook synchrotron_pulse.ipynb**

>**jupyter notebook detailed time structure.ipynb**
